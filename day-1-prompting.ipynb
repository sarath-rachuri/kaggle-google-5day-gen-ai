You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

While his brethren contentedly napped in sunbeams and plotted elaborate ways to snag tuna from countertops, Bartholomew yearned for adventure. He spent his days staring longingly out the window, watching the squirrels scamper through the park, their tails like fluffy question marks against the green. He dreamt of chasing them, of climbing the tallest trees, of discovering secrets hidden within the rustling leaves.\n\nOne day, his chance came. While his human, a kindly old woman named Mildred, was out shopping, Bartholomew slipped through a gap in the window screen. He landed with a soft thud on the grass, his heart pounding with the thrill of the unknown. The world, no longer confined to the walls of his home, stretched before him like a vast, green tapestry. He sniffed the air, a bouquet of fresh-cut grass and blooming flowers, and took his first tentative steps, leaving the familiar behind.\n\nHis first encounter was with a grumpy old tabby who lived in the nearby garden. The tabby, aptly named Grumpy, scoffed at Bartholomew's enthusiasm, muttering about \"unnecessary risks\" and \"the dangers of the great outdoors.\" Unfazed, Bartholomew continued his journey, weaving between flowerbeds and dodging startled birds. He met a mischievous ginger cat who taught him the art of snatching tuna from unattended picnic baskets and a sleek black cat who regaled him with tales of daring escapes from chasing dogs.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Bartholomew found himself on the edge of a dense forest. Curiosity piqued, he crept into the shadowy woodland, his senses heightened. He saw a family of deer grazing peacefully in a clearing, a wise old owl perched on a branch, its eyes gleaming like golden coins. He even saw a fox, its coat glowing orange in the twilight, watching him with an inquisitive gaze.\n\nHe spent the night huddled under a fallen log, the sounds of the forest a comforting lullaby. The next morning, he found himself lost, the familiar landmarks of his neighborhood replaced by a confusing maze of trees. But far from being scared, Bartholomew felt a surge of exhilaration. He had found something more meaningful than naps and tuna: he had found adventure.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and Bartholomew lived a life of freedom he had never known. He learned to hunt mice, to navigate the intricate pathways of the forest, and to understand the whispers of the wind. He had become a legend, a whisper among the other cats: Bartholomew, the cat who dared to explore.\n\nThen, one evening, he smelled something familiar: the scent of tuna, of lavender soap, of home. Following his nose, he found himself at the edge of his own garden, Mildred standing in the doorway, her eyes filled with worry. He nudged her hand, purring deep in his throat, and she gathered him in a warm embrace. He knew he would never forget his adventures, but he also knew that home, filled with love and the familiar scent of tuna, was where he belonged. He had found a balance between the yearning for exploration and the comfort of belonging. And he knew, with a certainty that only a cat with a heart full of adventure could have, that he would forever be a little bit wild, a little bit free. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Prompting\n\nThis section contains some prompts from the chapter for you to try out directly in the API.

Here's a breakdown of its main functionalities and why you would use it:\n\n**What It Does**\n\n* **Enhanced Git Prompt:** This script takes your standard bash prompt and adds Git-specific information:\n    * **Branch Name:** Displays the current Git branch you're working on.\n    * **Upstream Status:** Shows whether your branch is ahead of, behind, or in sync with its upstream remote branch.\n    * **File Status:** Indicates changes (staged, unstaged, untracked, conflicts) in your working directory.\n    * **Other Customization:** Allows you to configure how the information is displayed (colors, symbols, etc.).\n* **Themes:** Provides a variety of pre-defined color themes for the prompt. You can even create a custom theme.\n* **Virtual Environment Integration:** If you're using virtual environments (like Python's virtualenv), it can optionally display the active environment in your prompt.\n* **Prompt Customization:** Gives you flexibility to change the prompt's appearance and add custom elements.\n\n**Why You Would Use It**\n\n* **Improved Git Workflow:**  This script makes it easier to understand your Git status at a glance, saving you time and effort.\n* **Enhanced Terminal Experience:** Provides a visually appealing and informative prompt that makes your terminal more engaging.\n* **Customization:** Allows you to tailor the prompt to your preferences and work style.\n\n**How to Use It**\n\n1. **Save the code:** Save the code as a file named `bash-git-prompt.sh` in your home directory (or any location you prefer).\n2. **Source the script:** Add the following line to your `.bashrc` file:\n   ```bash\n   source ~/bash-git-prompt.sh\n   ```\n3. **Reload your shell:** Close and reopen your terminal, or run `source ~/.bashrc`.\n\nNow you should have a Git-aware prompt with all the bells and whistles. \n"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Learn more\n\nTo learn more about prompting in depth:\n\n* Check out the whitepaper issued with today's content,\n* Try out the apps listed at the top of this notebook ([TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/), [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) and [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/)),\n* Read the [Introduction to Prompting](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-intro) from the Gemini API docs,\n* Explore the Gemini API's [prompt gallery](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/prompts) and try them out in AI Studio,\n* Check out the Gemini API cookbook for [inspirational examples](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/) and [educational quickstarts](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/).\n\nAnd please share anything exciting you have tried in the Discord!","metadata":{"id":"2a8266d97ce5"}}]}
